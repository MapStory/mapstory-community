## Introduction

This document contains the current state of the MapStory roadmap. It will be dynamic as progress
is made and priorities shift as we learn more from users. 

### Immediate (within 4 weeks)

**[Annotations Improvements] (items/annotations.md)** - Bulk upload of annotations and a better editor.

**[Raster and uploader improvements] (items/raster.md)** - Iterative improvements for raster handling and 
uploading of data.


**[Buttonology] (items/buttonology.md)** - Moving of buttons and slimming of panels for more map real estate. 

**[Community Infrastructure] (items/community-infra.md)** - Better tools and structures for supporting the community, 
and to help the community support itself.


**[Organization pages] (items/org-pages.md)** - Pages for organizations to feature links and work in MapStory.
