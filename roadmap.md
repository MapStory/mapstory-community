## Introduction

This document contains the current state of the MapStory roadmap. It will be dynamic as progress
is made and priorities shift as we learn more from users. 

### Immediate (within 4 weeks)

**[Annotations Improvements] (items/annotations.md)** - Bulk upload of annotations and a better editor.

**[Raster and uploader improvements] (items/raster.md)** - Iterative improvements for raster handling and 
uploading of data.


**[Buttonology] (items/buttonology.md)** - Moving of buttons and slimming of panels for more map real estate. 

**[Community Infrastructure] (items/community-infra.md)** - Better tools and structures for supporting the community, 
and to help the community support itself.


**[Organization pages] (items/org-pages.md)** - Pages for organizations to feature links and work in MapStory.

### Short (1 month - 3 months)

New Uploader
 - client side validation
 - add a new raster to a mosiac
 - testing and awesome error messages

Search improvements

OL3 / new time slider investigation
 - start with just 'map' pages

Scalability improvements
 - GS 2.3
 - Cloudfront caching

Warper integration (first round)

**[OAuth integration with warper and wiki] (items/oauth.md)** - Enable MapStory login to work on http://warper.mapstory.org and http://wiki.mapstory.org

GeoGit on tools.mapstory.org

### Medium (3 month - 9 month)

**[Messaging between users] (items/messaging.md)** - Users should be able to send feedback and messages to one another
through the mapstory platform, without having to reveal their email addresses.

**[User control over 'resources for', 'sections', and 'topics'] (items/user-control.md)** - The same type of links and media ribbon
in organization pages should be customizable from the 'resources', 'sections' and 'topics' pages.

**[Improve storytellers/profile pages] (items/storytellers.md)** - We should enable links and media ribbon options for users.
And also should redo the whole profile/storyteller editing flow, as it's confusing.

Embed on more platforms

**[Iconcommons and better mapstory icons] (items/iconcommons.md)** - Create a sharing site for icons, for anyone to post 
open icons. And hook it in to the MapStory platform, so users can select from a wider variety of icons.

**[Developer Tab] (items/developer-tab.md)**

**[Social Login] (items/social-login.md)** Be able to login to mapstory with facebook and google, and grab the relevant 
picture, name and email.
