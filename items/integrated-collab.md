## Integrated Map Collaboration tools 

People will likely want more tools to work on MapStory with one another. Should investigate 
providing things like chat, wiki, issue trackers, etc. for their layers and maps.

### Notes

This is talking about at the level of an individual map or layer. How do we form a community
of people just working in depth on a single layer or set of layers of interest? For maps we'll
likely see more of a copy and edit model, with lots of different mapstories. But for layers
more tools probably make sense, things that let you collaborate with a number of people on
editing that layer.
