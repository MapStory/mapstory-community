## User Story

As a user, I need a way to import my data that represents geologic scale events, such as the formation of land features or the evolution of species.

## Requirements/spec

Obviously, geologic scale imports represent questions for our time structure. Should we abstract to epochs or eras of some definition? At minimum we should first support what our old importer supported at 290 million. Then, a solution should be implemented that lets us represent data for any point in Earth's 4.5 billion year history.
