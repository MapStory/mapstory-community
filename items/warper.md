## Warper integration

We have warper.mapstory.org, but it's a separate tool. We would like a more seamless workflow to 
upload scanned map and warp it and add to a StoryLayer.

### Requirements/spec

The overall requirement is to create a fairly seamless experience for people to upload unscanned maps, warp
them to be georeferenced, and add to their mapstories. Ideally not even feeling like there's a big difference
between warper.mapstory.org and mapstory.org proper. 

### Tech plan/notes

Research needed. May want to also investigate some batch processing / separate server for warping and tiling,
tell the users things are 'in process' before trying to serve them up right away.
