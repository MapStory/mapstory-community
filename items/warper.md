## User Story

We have warper.mapstory.org, but it's a separate tool. As a user, I would like a more seamless workflow to 
upload a scanned map to warper.mapstory.org, warp it, and add it to MapStory.org as a StoryLayer without having to download the image to my desktop and re-upload separately to MapStopry importer.

## Requirements/spec

The overall requirement is to create a fairly seamless experience for people to upload unscanned maps, warp
them to be georeferenced, and add to mapstory.org. Ideally not even feeling like there's a big difference
between warper.mapstory.org and mapstory.org proper. Research needed. May want to also investigate some batch processing / separate server for warping and tiling, tell the users things are 'in process' before trying to serve them up right away.
