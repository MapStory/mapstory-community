## Raster improvements and new uploader

We've got raster basics on production now, but it needs much testing and improvement. We should 
continue to support users on the raster issues that arise. We also have a new importer in GeoServer, 
but we still need to write the new uploader. 

### Requirements

The overall requirement is iterative improvement based on user feedback. We want to get to the point
where rasters work well in MapStory. 

The one major improvement is the upgrade of the uploader, to a more robust version, with nicer validation. It
will also be improved to allow the addition of a raster to a mosiac.

### Tech plan
To do this we need to upgrade to GeoServer 2.3.x. This involves porting time components to GeoTools 9.x, and
getting the mapstory security module working properly. And then testing to make sure there are no regressions.
