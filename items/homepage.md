***Requirements/Specs

The MapStory homepage needs a review, led by a designer. 

The current implementation leads with a call for user-searches, and basic calls to action: "import data", "compose mapstories", "sign-up now". Then, a set of mapstories are featured in the carousel. Below there are sections that feature priority initiatives and sponsors. The featured items and sponsor and initiative logos and links can be controlled by an admin in django.

Rey Dizon put forward an updated mockup that should be looked at first.

Other analogs we look at are change.org, kickstarter, YouTube, Medium. All of these combine our 2 purposes: a viewing platform that invites visitors to browser and explore, and a creation platform that invites people to register and build.

Wikipedia uses a super simple homepage that focuses on letting the user assert what language they want to view content in. Then, the user is brought to a second home page that serves as a digest of featured content, and a place to search or sign up.

If our Transifex language filter works properly, we don't need this first tier filter. Users should be able to change our basic homepage, and subsequent user experience, into whatever language they desire.
