The MapStory homepage needs a review. Current implementation does not do a good enough job explaining the purpose of the platform or inviting interested new visitors into the community.

Rey Dizon put forward an updated mockup that should be looked at first.

Other analogs we look at are change.org, kickstarter, YouTube, Medium. All of these combine our 2 purposes: a viewing platform that invites visitors to browser and explore, and a creation platform that invites people to register and build.
