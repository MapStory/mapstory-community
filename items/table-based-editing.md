## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to make edits to a StoryLayer by inputting content into fields on a table view, rather than only by editing features on the map.

## Requirements/spec

Currently edits can only be made to layers "on the map". Many users will want to edit attributes of a feature from a list or table view. Current editing mode provides a table view, but edits cannot be captured from the table in the version history.
