## User Story

As a user, I want to view old stories created on retro that are no published in mapstory.org. the problem is, these stories did not have both "chapter info" and "summary info". I need a solution that makes viewing these stories on the new Detail Page rationale.

## Requirements

The most logical solution is probably to hide the "Chapter Summary" space on the story detail page, so it just appears in the Story Summary area. On the map, the info should be in the sidebar area.
