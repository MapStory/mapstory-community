## User Story

As a developer, I need a clearly articulated DevOps pipeline that provides the core team of developers working on the project clarity in how our code gets written, tested, and deployed, and gives users and Product Owners confidence that we are organized to address downtime or surpises quickly.

## Requirements/Specs

This area of work has 2 focuses:

1) refining the DevOps pipeline for MapStory.org in terms of new features (roadmap>wireframes>local>demo>production) and response to user centered bugs and issues (UserSnap>Github)

2) Achieving ATO of the StoryScapes version of MapStory.org (see Redmine).
