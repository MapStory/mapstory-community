## Search improvements in Map Composer

The next round of search improvements in the Map Composer should make it more like the site's search,
with sorting by popularity, newness, etc. And it should display thumbnails and abstracts. Ideally it
also lets users filter the search by current spatial and temporal extents.

### Spec

This is in process and in a decent state. See the tickets for what's on tap. We want to push this out
soon.

### People
Ivan started, Steven should help with design decisions, and may tap Bart to help out some.

### Issues

[Overview of Issues] (https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues?labels=New+Map+Search&milestone=11&page=1&state=open)

The most important remaining ones are:

https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues/683
https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues/680
https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues/656 (just adjust to 25 results)
https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues/681
https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues/682

We can hold off on the two to limit by spatial extent and time, but they would be nice to get in. Steven may also
make some more suggestions that we should implement.
