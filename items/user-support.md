## User support and iterative improvements

This is to remind us to always do some immediate improvements and support of user needs. The best way to 
develop software is to make it better for the people actually using it. We should go beyond their immediate
problems though to improvements that prevent others from hitting the same issues in the future.

### Requirements

Anything that is requested by a real, individual user of MapStory. Every release we should be doing at 
least 20% of our time on these, if not more.

### People
All

### Issues

There is the [Triage label] (https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues?labels=Triage&state=open) which 
has been used to mark user issues. But it's not used consistently by all.
