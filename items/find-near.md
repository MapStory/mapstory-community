## Find near in space and time 

At a feature level people should be able to find other data near where they are in the map, in both 
space and time. So search by feature, not just bounding box of data.

### Notes

This is quite hard with the WFS interface. What we really want to do is search _all_ features on 
the server. Could design a new web interface for this.
