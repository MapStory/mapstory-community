## Buttonology

We've got lots of superfluous buttons and panels. Let's slim them down and get to a bigger map.

### Requirements

The general requirement is to create more space for the map. In general we're doing away with the
top bar of buttons, eliminating them or moving beside the time buttons.

### People
