## User Story

As a user, I want to "hide" any storylayers I don't want to appear in the legend. Also, the basemap toggle should be put back in the legend drop down so that a viewer can change the basemap that a story is viewed in (in Interactive Mode)

## Requirements

Currently the legend shows the StoryLayers in a chapter, and any styling information (stastical breaks, etc). Also, a user can "mask" the layer and styling information in their Legend to control the text that is present.

We should improve improve on this by letting the storytelling "hide" any storylayers he/she doesn't want to appear in the legend. Also, the basemap toggle should be put back in the legend drop down.
