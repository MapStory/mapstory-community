##Legend Enhancements 

Rework the legend to not take up so much space and be more intuitive.

### Requirements and wireframes




##### General

* Tweak opacity of background so text is easier to read (also need to try on a variety of maps)
* Add a close button (use bootstrap icon)

##### StoryLayers
* Display symbols to the left of the label
* When a layer has multiple symbols, show the layer title and then a list of the symbols below the title
* Click a layer name to toggle the visibility of that layer (see HighCharts demo for example of similar functionality -- click on any item in the legend to toggle)
* Click an item within a layer to toggle visibility of that item
* TBD: continuous ranges/scales

##### BaseMap
* Convert to a dropdown
* If there is a legend associated with base map, show in same style as StoryLayers
* Show legend below the dropdown
