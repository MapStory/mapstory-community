##Requirements/Specs

The Journal is designed as a place for all registered users to author posts that can be shared with the community. Posts might be about events users are hosting, updates on projects they are working on, links to resources, general thought pieces, and more.

Currently a juser can author an entry. To style text with bold, italics, etc they must use markdown. Posts are listed in the Journal by most-recent. There is no other way to filter. Once a post is published, it also appears on a user profile.

An upgrade to the Journal will focus on:

- [ ] Adding a WYSIWYG editor to make authoring easier. Priority WYSIWYG functions are: bold, italics, underline, header (1-5), bulletted (dots and numbers), quote, hyperlink
- [ ] Let author upload images as part of their post.
- [ ] Let any author add tags to their post. Have auto-complete for tags to promote common spellings
- [ ] Let administrator add tags to any post
- [ ] Let administrator set select posts as "featured", which keeps them at the top despite publishing date
- [ ] Let reader target posts by clicking on tags and filtering content
- [ ] Let reader target posts by toggling between "most recent" or "most read"
