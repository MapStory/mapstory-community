## Requirements/Specs

The MapStory detail page as currently configured provides a viewer with options to
- [ ] play a story
- [ ] see the summary, categories and tags for a story
- [ ] see the chapters and layers in a story

If the owner of the story is on the story detail page they can also:
- [ ] change the thumbnail for the story

In a future version of the mapstory detail page, we should consider giving the owner of a story more ability to customize the viewer page for their story. For example, they should be able to update the summary or chapter info presented right from the detail page, without having to go into composer.

What other ideas are there?
