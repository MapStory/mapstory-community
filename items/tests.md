## User Story

As a developer, I expect the application to have full test coverage for existing code before I begin working on new features, so that I can be confident no regressions will occur.

## Requirements/Specs

As of December 2017, the MapStory.org codebase stands at about 37% coverage. To succeed at scale, we need to increase this number to as close to 100% as possible.
