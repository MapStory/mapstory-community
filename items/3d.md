## 3D MapStories 

There are several cool WebGL toolkits that may let us view MapStories not just in 2D but 
in 3D, over time. We should incorporate these.

### Notes

Cesium is the top of the list, they've done some cool timeline stuff, and are fully webgl 3d enabled.

OpenLayers 3 will hopefully provide some stuff, and make it easy to incorporate Cesium.

To do this truly right there's some backend infrastructure in GeoServer/GeoTools to enable, but that's
for true 3D, and we can probably do quite a lot without that. But would be good to track, as others
may fund. And there's some cool w3ds stuff being done in GeoServer. Be able to bring in collada models
and the like potentially.
