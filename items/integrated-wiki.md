## Integrated Wiki 

Right now we use mediawiki. Would be cool to find a way so edits in the wiki are integrated 
with activity feeds on the MapStory site.

### Notes

One route is to hook up to mediawiki actions in some way. Maybe they provide rss output?

Other route is use like a django wiki that hooks in more easily.
