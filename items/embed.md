## Embed on more platforms

MapStory's should be embeddable everywhere. Right now we have an iframe, but we need to deploy oembed
and then get whitelisted on various large sites, figuring out the tech to deploy on each.

### Requirements

Top of the list is oembed, the format needed to get on the wordpress platform. Then we need
to get whitelisted on wordpress.com. Should also research other potential embeds.

### Tech plan / status

We have an oembed plugin thing for django deployed on dev. It needs more testing on the output
before going to production.
