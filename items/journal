##Requirements/Specs

The Journal is designed as a place for all registered users to author posts that can be shared with the community. Posts might be about events users are hosting, updates on projects they are working on, links to resources, general thought pieces, and more.

Currently a juser can author an entry. To style text with bold, italics, etc they must use markdown. Posts are listed in the Journal by most-recent. There is no other way to filter. Once a post is published, it also appears on a user profile.

An upgrade to the Journal will focus on 3 aslects:

- [ ] Adding a WYSIWYG editor to make authoring easier
- [ ] Adding basic filters for finding posts, such as tags and "most recent" versus "most read"
