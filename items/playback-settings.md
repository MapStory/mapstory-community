## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view a published story with 2 basic modes: "Museum" and "Interactive". Museum Mode means that a story can be played from start to finish with no viewer interactivity required. All StoryPin media will play automatically, chapters will transition automatically, etc. Interactive mode means that that, while the storyteller can set the "default playback settings" he/she would prefer a viewer to view the story in, the viewer can always hit "pause" and engage with content...like clicking StoryPins on and off, or scrolling back and forth on the timeline.

## Requirements

### For Museum Mode

- [ ] StoryPin media automatically plays, and then story resumes when media is complete
- [ ] StoryPin content can scroll in the sidebar, as well as on the map.

### For Interactive Mode

- [ ] Create a button that lets a viewer "return to origin settings" of the chapter in a story and begin the chapter again with the original default playback settings in tact that the storyteller wanted
- [ ] allow viewer to toggle basemaps on a story
- [ ] allow viewer to toggle layers and legend on/off
- [ ] allow user to zoom in and out on the story and play the story with those zoom settings persisted until changed.
