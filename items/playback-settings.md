## Single Chapter Mapstories ("short stories")

The viewer page for a single chapter mapstory should not show the "chapter info" and "summary" information twice, as it currently does.

## Museum Playback Mode

The so-called "museum mode" implies that a mapstory could be played all the through, and continuously, without any user interactivity. Thus, in a museum, the mapstory could continuously display without any action by staff. Museum requires that chapter transitions happen without user click, that StoryPin pop-ups occur automatically, and that any embedded media in StoryPins plays automatically as well.

## Interactive Mode

An interactive mode would be a mode where viewers of the mapstory can interact with features in the story. For example, a user could zoom in and out on the map interface, thus overriding the default zoom settings that the storytelling set. Also, a user could click on features to see FeatureBox popups. Also, the user could scrub the timeline to see features play aggressively, or change the playback rate of a chapter. Interactive Mode should have a 'magic button' that lets a viewer "return to origin settings" of the chapter and begin the chapter again with the original settings in tact.
