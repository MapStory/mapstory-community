## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to lead a Community Initiatives. A community initiative is a mass crowdsourcing/crowdediting effort on a specific set of layers with defined schemas. They are given their own page as a home-base for participants in the initiative to track progress on the layers that are part of the initiative. The MapStory Foundation gives administrative power to a set of users that manage the Initiative page.

## Requirements/Specs

- [ ] Initiative Leads need to be able to set a pre-set schema with common attribute requirements and vocabularies that must apply to any StoryLayers that become part of the Initiative (This requirement overlaps with the Gazetteer work)

- [ ] MapStory administrators should be able to create an "Initiative Page" through the django-admin backend. The Initiative Page should display the StoryLayers that are considered part of the Initiative; the users that are considered the "Leads"; Journal Entries that have a Tag for the Initiative; what else?
