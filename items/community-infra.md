## Community Initiatives

Community Initiatives are mass crowdsourcing/crowdediting efforts on a specific set of layers with defined schemas. They are given their own page as a home-base for participants in the initiative to track progress on the layers that are part of the initiative. The MapStory Foundation gives administrative power to a set of users that manage the Initiative page.

The User Stories required to enable Community Initiatives include:

Our help and support infrastructure is all over the place. We should attempt to improve it enough so
that a community can bootstrap itself.

As a user, I need to be able to seamlessly view any amount of data, across the full breadth of the Earth. Similar to how someone can explore the world with Google Maps or Google Earth, or Openstreetmap.

As a user, I need to be able to append any amount of data to layers.

As a user, I need to be able to delete and upload, or replace a swath of data, say for a city when the data is updated.

As a user, I need to be able to collaborate with any number of other users in editing the same mapstory.

As a user, I need to be able to aggressively scrub any data at any zoom level.

As a user, I need to keep track of versioning.

As a user, I need to be able to view data in a readable way on any scale, and have labeling and display adapt according to zoom level.

As a user, I need to be able to see versioning on any selection or portion of data.

As a user, I need to be able to edit any data, both drawing on the map and typing attributes.

As a user, I need to be able to upload and download any portion of a layer.

As a user, I need there to be some users with the ability to set permissions for other users, to be used in cases of arbitration on vandalism and other incorrect edits.

As a user, I need to be able to use an initiative storylayer as a base mapstory for other mapstories.

As a user, I need to be able to create, edit and select different style sets, in the same way someone can select different basemaps.
