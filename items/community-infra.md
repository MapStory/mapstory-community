## Community Infrastructure

Our help and support infrastructure is all over the place. We should attempt to improve it enough so
that a community can bootstrap itself.

### Requirements

Top of the list is to sort out the mess of help, manual, and how to, along with the wiki and the blog.
We should get to the point where it's easy to find all the information to help, and where relatively
non-technical people can contribute to making things better.

Past that installing http://osqa.net and making it a forum for people to help one another would be great.

And would be good to think through how best to help people and triage issues in a way that is not 
burdensome to the developers.
