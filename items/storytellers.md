## User Story

As a user, I need to be able control the order in which my published storylayers and mapstories appear on my public profile.

Right now, all of my published StoryLayers and MapStories simply appear on a most-recent basis. I should have more control over the order and prominence given to items shown on my profile.

In fact, we may want to go further and provide storytellers with a personal "dashboard" that is separate from their storyteller profile page where they can manage their projects and profile. This would become a sort of "homepage" for them when using mapstory.

## Requirements

Tech should hopefully be straightforward, mostly django pages. Could be nice to get some nicer
javascript touches, for in line editing of information.
