## Analysis and web processing 

Provide ways to enable more advanced analysis of MapStory data, creating new stories as a result 
of analysis of other layers. May make sense to go under tools.mapstory.org

### Notes

We at the MapStory Foundation are still struggling to determine how we want to harness all of the 
innovation being presented by the revolution in online web processing. Providing users with simple 
analytical tools such as dynamic “heat map” generation seems obvious enough, as it really enhances 
their ability to communicate visually. However, the OpenGeo software stack on which MapStory is built 
already has 92 different analytical models, and this only promises to grow. In the end, these models 
will not just be 2D, but 2D plus time, 2.5D plus time, and then full 4D. Such models will require very 
little development effort to integrate, but lots of effort in order to make them lay accessible.

We encourage those within the MapStory community who are passionate on these issues to be vocal, and to 
help us define a vision that is feasible and which provides the greatest number of participants the greatest 
amount of value. We look forward to your comments as we move forward on this front.
