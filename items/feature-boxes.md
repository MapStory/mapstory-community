### Requirements/spec

FeatureBoxes are the popups that display attribute information about a feature in a StoryLayer. 

Currently in composer, the storyteller can "mask" the names of attributes to control how the content in the FeatureBox looks. 

We need to make sure FeatureBoxes can be accessed on click in interactive mode on a published mapstory. Also, as the Gazetteer work comes online, we will be able to amend the FeatureBox to include the "did you know" info.
