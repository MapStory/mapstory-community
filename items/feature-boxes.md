## User Story

As a user, I want FeatureBoxes that can be accessed on click in interactive mode on a published mapstory. Also, as the Gazetteer work comes online, we will be able to amend the FeatureBox to include the "did you know" info.


## Requirements

FeatureBoxes are the popups that display attribute information about a feature in a StoryLayer. 

Currently in composer, the storyteller can "mask" the names of attributes to control how the content in the FeatureBox looks. 

Currenty in viewer, a user cannot yet view the FeatureBox pop-up, although this is an issue currently being worked on by Clarence Davis.
