## User Story

As a user, I want to leverage the location services on my mobile device to help MapStory.org search for StoryLayers or MapStories (or even individual features...per the gazetteer work) that are "near me"

## Requirement

Somehow, we could tie the location services of most mobile devices into MapStory search, so that you could generate a search for content that implicates the place you currently find yourself.
