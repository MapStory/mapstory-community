MapStory currently provides mechanisms for "peer reviewing" StoryLayers - aside from editing features themselves. These mechanisms include providing a "Star Rating" and flagging the layer for inaccuracy, violating terms, or being broken.

We haven't yet thought deeply about the metrics that drive these tools, or how they are communicated to the user.

Also, what other peer review tools might help a user understand the completeness and accuracy of a layer?
