## User Story

MapStory currently provides a start-rating mechanism for "peer reviewing" StoryLayers. As a user, I need more understanding of the algorithm that defines these ratings. For example, is there a minimum number of ratings that are needed before a rating will occur? Also, how to we break ties? Does every user's rating count equally, or do some users have more weighted impact in their ratings?

Also, what other peer review tools might help a user understand the completeness and accuracy of a layer?
