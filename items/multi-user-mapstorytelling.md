## User Story

As a user, I want to work on a MapStory alongside other registered users, and then publish it as being by all of us who worked on it. 

## Requirement/Spec

Currently a mapstory can only be published under a single account, and be worked on by the owner of that account. Multi-user storytelling will let the same mapstory be attributed to multiple account. Also, multi-user mapstorytelling would ultimnately let multiple users work on the same mapstory _at the same time_, much like they would a google doc.
