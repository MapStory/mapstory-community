## Styling Greatness 

Intuitive styling of maps is of key importance to MapStory's success. We need to match 
the baseline of what others do through the web, and push the limits.

The next generation of styling for MapStory will focuse on dealing with the "clutter" that will emerge with mapstories that have several layers and large amounts of features. Clustering features that become "unclustered" upon zoom, and blobbing features into density heat maps are two starter solutions to think about.

###

CartoDB and MapBox are the ones really innovating with this. The cartodb approach is probably 
most apt for MapStory - an intuitive GUI to create basic styles and generate some more 
complex ones (intensity, quantiles). And those are always reflected in CSS, which one can 
always edit directly. 

Ideally we also standardize CSS for maps, between CartoCSS and GeoServer's CSS stuff.
