## Styling Greatness 

Intuitive styling of maps is of key importance to MapStory's success. We need to match 
the baseline of what others do through the web, and push the limits.

### Notes

CartoDB and MapBox are the ones really innovating with this. The cartodb approach is probably 
most apt for MapStory - an intuitive GUI to create basic styles and generate some more 
complex ones (intensity, quantiles). And those are always reflected in CSS, which one can 
always edit directly. 

May involve some fundamental redoing of our stuff, especially getting CSS working well. 

Ideally we also standardize CSS for maps, between CartoCSS and GeoServer's CSS stuff.
