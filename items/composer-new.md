### Requirements/spec

Now that we have all the basic components for mapstorytelling in place (chapters, pins, frames, styling), we need to implement a fresh composer UI. The current UI was meant as a "utilitarian" interface that wouild simply give buttonology to emerging features. The new design must now optimize the composer for novice users who aren't familiar with our terms and workflows.

### User Stories for storytelling

As a user, I need to be able to customize how the Get Feature Info appears for the features in my StoryLayers when I’m working in composer, and if a viewer of my story will be able to click on features to see Get Feature Info or not.

As a user, I need to be able to click on the Get Feature Info / Infobox on a feature of a published story in which the creator of that story has set it so I can click on features.

As a user, when I’m composing a story I need a better way to see all the elements I’ve added to my story - layers, boxes, pins (Table of Contents)

As a user, when composing a story I need to be able to click and drag StoryLayers to different chapters rather than having to add a StoryLayer again in the chapter

As a user, I need to have the zoom resolution on my published story appear as I set it when composing the story.

As a user, I want to be able to set the playback rate for my chapters.

As a user, I need to pick between a set of Templates that correspond with the type of ‘story’ I have in mind.

As a user, I need to add information to the Chapter Info content box that can be interactive with the map interface (i.e. charts, graphs).

As a user, I need to download a story in a print format that is coherent to use as a handout (i.e. pdf).

As a user, I need to show my features in a clustered view if there are a high number of them, to make viewing more graceful at different zoom levels.

As a user, I need to view stories with elevation data (4D - cesium)

As a user, I need to compose a story with other users also composing on that same story, at the same time

As a user, I need to have multiple users be assigned as “authors” of the same story, if they helped to work on it.
