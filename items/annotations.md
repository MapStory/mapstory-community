### Description

MapStory's annotations are so bad as to be practically unusable. Let's make them at least usable.

### Goal

Our aim for this task is not annotations perfection, just to get them to a decent state. It should be 
possible to upload annotations, to edit any existing annotation, ideally with some bulk editing options,
and to add youtube and pictures.

### Spec / Requirements

 - upload
 - edit with grid
 - media

### Wireframes

## Tech thoughts / plan

 - refactor backend
 - stick with ext on front end
 - openlayers protocol
