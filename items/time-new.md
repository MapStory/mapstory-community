### Description

The current time slider does not work well. While it has been going iterative improvement the 
existing codebase is hard for our current developers to maintain, as we no longer have the original
author. It should be refactored to a nicer control, investigating new technologies like OpenLayers 3.0
and new javascript toolkits. 

### Goal


### Requirements
 
To make sure we don't lose functionality this list is an attempt to list what the new time slider should support.

 - variable speed (more than just 2x, but to do that it could combine frames)
 - prebuffering
 - aggressive time sliding - updating when moving slider
 - cumulative and normal playback.
