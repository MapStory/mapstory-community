## User Story

Provide a gazetteer that is accurate with names that evolve over time.

### Requirements

The gazetteer will allow us to link data at a feature level, and to organize knowledge about individual features across layers.

The first level implementation of the gazetteer should 1) add schema support to importer, so that if a user has a "place name" in their import, they are coached to present that place name in accordance with a format supported in the gazatteer 2) Incorporate into StoryLayer detail page playback a Get Feature Info/ FeatureBox that has additional contextual information generated by the gazetteeer (i.e. "Did you know?"....) 3 An Open Linked Data API information to search indexes so that a “search” for a “place” that is part of the Gazetteer generates results showing, for example, all the StoryLayers and StoryScapes that reference that “place”

Harvard has started some work on this, should build on that.

This needs to be a massive crowd sourced effort all on its own.
