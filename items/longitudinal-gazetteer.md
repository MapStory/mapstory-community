## Longitudinal Gazetteer 

Provide a gazetteer that is accurate with names that evolve over time.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to add the Place Names referenced in the data I upload to a longitudinal gazetteer that helps link place names across layers.

As a user, I want to Implement pilot “Get Feature Info / InfoBox” workflow that enables users in composer, and viewers of published layers and stories, to click on a feature and see attribute information of the feature, as well as additional contextual (“Did You Know?”) information if the feature is a “Place” recognized by the Gazetteer.

Add Open Linked Data API information to search indexes so that a “search” for a “place” that is part of the Gazetteer generates results showing, for example, all the StoryLayers and StoryScapes that reference that “place”


### Notes

Harvard has started some work on this, should build on that.

This needs to be a massive crowd sourced effort all on its own.
