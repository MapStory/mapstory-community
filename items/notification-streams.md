## Requirements/spec

MapStory.org currently lets users opt-in to a set of Notifications, using stoxk Geonode. We should take a hard look at our implementation of these in order to maximize user engagement. The goal of notifications in MapStory.org should be two-fold: 1) to make sure users can tracky any activity on content they created and 2) to easily let them follow activity on issues they care about.
