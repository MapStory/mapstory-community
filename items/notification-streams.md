## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to decide on how I am notified by email, or via my personal profile, about certain actions that occur on MapStory.org

## Requirements/spec

- [ ] Review and update notification options: MapStory.org currently lets users opt-in to a set of Notifications, using stock Geonode options. Clicking yes to a notification means that a user receives a direct email in order to be notified of some answer. We should take a hard look at our implementation of these in order to maximize user engagement. The goal of notifications in MapStory.org should be two-fold: 1) to make sure users can track any activity on content they created and 2) to easily let them follow activity on issues they care about. 

- [ ] Create a notification summary space on the profile, as well as email notification: We should add a place on the user profile (private view) where a user can see their latest notifications so that "email" isn't the only option.
