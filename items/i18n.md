## User Story

MapStory should be available to people regardless of what language they speak. We should 
make sure the site is all internationalized and start a crowd sourced localization effort.

## Requirements

Ideally this is done in a way that contributes translations to all the underlying components - 
GeoNode, OpenLayers, Django, etc. Transifex seems to be a great infrastructure for this, and
GeoNode is already working with it.

GeoNode has in the past done a nice drop down to select different languages, would be good
to have that too.
