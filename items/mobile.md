## Mobile Search and Playback

Users should be able to visit mobile-friendly version of mapstory.org on a mobile device and conduct basic searches of StoryLayers and MapStories and then "playback" content.

### Notes

We will need to think through the best playback settings for layers and stories viewed on a mobile device. 

It would be great to leverage the "location-aware" nature of mobile devices so that layers, stories (and even features) that implicate "where you are" can be pushed up in a search.
