## Mobile 

Mobile devices are the platform of the future. We need to determine what the MapStory
experience on a mobile device should be.

### Notes

Our first priority is to ensure that MapStory resources can be discovered, viewed and interacted with 
from mobile and tablet devices – especially location-aware devices – so users can experience the past 
while physically moving through it. Second, we intend to empower users to make versioned edits while mobile. 
Third, we will explore the feasibility and ergonomics of mobile MapStory authoring. Fourth, as we move 
forward with full 4D support, we intend to push this all the way to the mobile device. In all cases, 
we are very concerned about mobile users in scenarios where they are “network challenged.” We are 
already very focused on technical mechanisms that allow mobile platforms to cache data offline, 
which are coming along quickly.

Would be good to do geopackage output from MapStory, as that spec finalizes. Will need to work through
some UI issues, like if we give tiles or vectors in the package, how we let the user select that. Probably
we also want to experiment with including styling information.
