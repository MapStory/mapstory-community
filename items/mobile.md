## User Story

Users should be able to visit mobile-friendly version of mapstory.org on a mobile device and conduct basic searches of StoryLayers and MapStories and then "playback" content in a way that is formatted for that device.

## Requirements

We will need to think through the best playback settings for layers and stories viewed on a mobile device. It might make sense to have a set "playback mode" for mobile that is different than Museum and Interactive that feels more like an Animated Gif. See then gifs Rey Dizon created and shared on MapStory's twitter account (i.e. https://twitter.com/cartoranger/status/605782865620537345). These present the title and time information in a simple and clear way.
