## User Story

As a user, I need to be able to upload my raster imagery, either as a single raster image, or a zipped sequence of imagery

## Requirements

Retro.mapstory.org had basic support for Raster imagery upload. We've lost that in the new build. First step is to understand how it used to be handled.
