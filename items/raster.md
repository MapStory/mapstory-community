## Raster improvement

The raster work just landed on production, so needs more iterations of user testing to get solid.

### Requirements

To be reported by users. This likely will include other user support, so will take a decent bit of 
time, but should get to more solid raster backend. But it should help flesh out other site improvements
related to uploading and beyond.

Some client side improvements will also help, to inform users earlier on when something is wrong.
