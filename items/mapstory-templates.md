## User Story

As users begin to make mapstories, we will start to see a variety of "types" emerge. As this happens, we should start to define a set of "templates" that guide the storyteller in composing a story of a particular type.

For example, many journalists will want to tell "quick stories" that almost serve as Animated Gifs. these stories will likely be a single chapter, be set a fast playback rate, etc.
