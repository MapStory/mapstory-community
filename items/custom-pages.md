## Admin control over 'resources for', 'sections', and 'topics' pages

The same type of links and media ribbon in organization pages should be customizable from the
'resources', 'sections' and 'topics' pages.

### Requirements

Should be pretty straight forward. The one requirement is that improvements to the links and media ribbon
control should be easily made in all the different types of pages. Like those should be generic little
tools we can stick on most any page, so admins and users can control what they want.
