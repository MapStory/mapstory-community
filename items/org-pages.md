## Organization Pages

Organizations should be able to customize a presence on MapStory, similar how one can on MeetUp. 
### Requirements

Just need admin control for now, so does not need to look pretty. All the basics are done at
http://mapstory.dev.opengeo.org/mapstory-foundation/ so won't describe everything now.

### Future work

Make things more intuitive. We will be getting user feedback as MapStory interns this summer
will make some sample pages, using our interface. So we should use their feedback to make an interface
that anyone can use.

### People
Started by Ian, with work by Jeff and Ivan, and soon Marc
