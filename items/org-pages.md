## Organization Pages

Organizations should be able to customize a presence on MapStory, similar how one can on MeetUp. 

### Requirements

A user should be able to be given "admin rights" over an Organization Page. This empowers them to edit the Organization Page profile and add storytellers to the profile.

We should also develop an "analytics digest" that can be shared with Org Page administrators. The analytics would provide intel on use of layers, edit history, stories published, data downloads, and other items of interest to Org Page administrators as we learn needs over time.
