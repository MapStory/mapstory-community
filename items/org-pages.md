## Organization Pages

Organizations should be able to customize a presence on MapStory, similar how one can on MeetUp. 

### Requirements

The organization page should be at a simple URL, like www.mapstor.org/OrgName

A user should be able to be given "admin rights" over an Organization Page. This empowers them to edit the Organization Page profile and add storytellers to the profile. Similar function to a Facebook organization page.

The Org page design should feel like a "home page for an organization". We should consider a nice carousel for layers and stories the Org wants to feature.

We should also develop an "analytics digest" that can be shared with Org Page administrators. The analytics would provide intel on use of layers, edit history, stories published, data downloads, and other items of interest to Org Page administrators as we learn needs over time.
