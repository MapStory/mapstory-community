## Better permissioning 

Right now MapStories and StoryLayers are not very collaborative, you can't invite someone 
else to edit data or a story with you. Should bring in better permissioning to enable that, 
and to also investigate techniques to get high quality metadata.

### Notes

There are quite a few collaborative workflows to handle here. We want to enable people to
easily work together, and create their own amount of 'openness' to others contributing,
on annotations, storylayer data and metadata.
