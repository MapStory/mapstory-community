## Requirements/spec

The purpose of the "StoryLayer detail page" is to provie a user with a overview of the data provided in a StoryLayer, and the status of its community editing work. The information displayed on the StoryLayer detail page should help a user make 2 decisions 1) Can/should they edit it to make it more complete and accurate? And, can/should they use it in a MapStory?

Currently, the StoryLayer detail page provides a user with basic metadata and a summary of how many times the layer has been edited, and by how many users. 

The next-generation StoryLayer detail page should provide more information, such as:

- [] Heatmap/timeline to show density of edits over time (similar to Github)
- [] List of sources used by all editors (like footnotes)
- [] Contributing editors presented as a "leaderboard"
