================

This repository is dedicated to maintaining an evolving Product Vision and Roadmap for MapStory. This Roadmap is focused on the purpose and features associated with the platform. 

If you're interested in Developer docs associated with MapStory.org, you should see the Wiki in the main [MapStory repo] (https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/wiki). 

See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for the main Roadmap document.

The [items/](items/) folder contains the actual details on the tasks for the roadmap. 
To read those it is best to just follow the links from the roadmap, as the items will
then be ordered properly.

### Adding to the roadmap

To create a new roadmap item add an entry to `roadmap.md` following the same structure as the 
other links, and create a new page under `items/`. You can use this [template](items/template.md)
to copy and paste in to your new item to follow the general structure of other items.

But there are no hard rules for items and the headings, except to make them useful for project
management and developers. 

### Maintaining the roadmap

The Roadmap should be updated by Product Owners at least once per month. Items within themes should be listed in order of priority.
