mapstory-community
================

This repository is dedicated to gathering and tracking progress on efforts to strengthen the MapStory community, keeping these ideas separate from the code oriented repositories, and the content oriented one.

If you're a developer interested in getting involved in MapStory's codebase, you should see the Wiki in the main [MapStory repo] (https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/wiki). 

### Adding to the mapstory-community repo

Anyone is welcome to submit a ticket with ideas for strengthening the community. Your ticket should provide as much detail about your idea as possible, as well as the requirements or pre-requisites involved in making the idea a reality (for example, does it require funding? specific partners? etc.)


### Maintaining the roadmap

MapStory.org administrators maintain this repository.
