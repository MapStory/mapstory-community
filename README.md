mapstory-roadmap
================

This repository is dedicated to maintaining an evolving roadmap for MapStory.

See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for the main document.

The [items/](items/) folder contains the actual details on the tasks for the roadmap. 
To read those it is best to just follow the links from the roadmap, as the items will
then be ordered properly.

This roadmap is _not_ a marketing document, other more user/funder
friendly documents can be created for that. The MapStory wiki's 
[Technology Roadmap](http://wiki.mapstory.org/index.php?title=Technology_Roadmap) is currently the best place for that. This is a space for actual
organization of the development work, taking roadmap items and fleshing them out with requirements,
specifications, technology plans, wireframes, issues and more as we move from idea to implementation.

To create a new roadmap item add an entry to `roadmap.md` following the same structure as the 
other links, and create a new page under `items/`. You can use this [template](items/template.md)
to copy and paste in to your new item to follow the general structure of other items.

But there are no hard rules for items and the headings, except to make them useful for project
management and developers.
